# AI-Based IoT Camera for Posture Correction

## Proposed Solution

### Explanation

This project involves the creation of a smart posture correction system comprising two components:

1. **Hardware/IoT Device**: An AI-powered camera system designed to monitor and analyze sitting posture.
2. **Companion App**: A mobile and desktop application for configuration, notifications, and metrics tracking.

### Addressing the Problem

Poor posture is a common issue leading to long-term health problems such as back pain, spinal misalignment, and reduced productivity. Existing solutions often compromise privacy by relying on cloud-based analysis or lack comprehensive features for health improvement.

### Innovation

This solution emphasizes privacy by performing on-device detection. It incorporates advanced posture tracking, health insights, and smart home integrations, creating a holistic system for improving ergonomics and back health.
